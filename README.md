📊 Zomato Data Analysis Project Using Tableau Public.

I’m excited to share my latest project where I conducted a detailed analysis of the Zomato restaurant dataset using Tableau Public. 

🔹Project Name → Zomato Data Analysis.
🔹Tool Used → Tableau Public.
🔹Domain → Market research | Restaurant Industry| Consumer Behaviour Analysis| Business Intelligence.
🔹Dataset Type → Excel Data.

In this analysis, I uncovered key trends and insights related to restaurant growth, pricing, ratings, and consumer preferences. The project helped me gain hands-on experience in data visualization and analysis, and I want to share some of the visualizations I've created:

 🔸 Restaurant Growth by Year/Quarter/Month
 🔸 Restaurant Distribution by City & Country (Map View)
 🔸 Count of Restaurants by Price Bucket
 🔸 Restaurant Ratings Distribution
 🔸 Online Orders vs Table Booking Availability
 🔸 Count of Restaurants and Average Rating

Key insights from this project -

✅Analysed how the number of restaurants has evolved over time and correlated it with consumer ratings.
✅Visualized the distribution of restaurants across different price ranges and countries, providing a clear picture of the competitive landscape.
✅Compared the rise of online orders versus table bookings, highlighting the shift toward digital dining experiences. 

How This Analysis Can Help -

✅Optimizing Menu Offerings → By identifying popular cuisines, restaurant owners can focus on trending dishes, enhancing their menu and customer satisfaction.
✅Pricing Strategy → Insights into price range trends allow businesses to adjust their pricing strategy to stay competitive and attract more customers.
✅Location-Based Insights → Data on restaurant performance across different cities helps businesses decide on the best locations for new branches.
✅Customer Engagement & Marketing → Analysing customer ratings and reviews enables marketing teams to craft targeted campaigns that resonate with their audience.
